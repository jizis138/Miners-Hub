    <string name="about_developer_text">Being a native of the Russian capital of mining - Irkutsk,
         it was impossible not to notice the mining hype that swept the city in 2021,
         let alone try it yourself.\n\nSince then, the idea and even lack of such a tool as a profitability calculator started up.
         Therefore, I present to you the application of my development.\n\nLeaving a bad or good review in the Play Market
         you motivate me to keep developing this app,
         and also send your ideas and suggestions by mail,
         you have a great chance to contribute to the development of this project.
